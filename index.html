This shows that the top 10 car manufacturers own just over 50% of the market at 53.4%. 
                        Furthermore the top 3 gas car manufacturers "Chevrolet", "Ford", and "Dodge" own almost 25% of the entire market at 24.92%.
                         This places the top 3 companies well ahead of the next 3 big companies "GMC", "Toyota", "BMW" who own only 15.86% of the market.
                         Finally, at the last 4 companies "Nissan", "Mercedes-Benz", "Volkswagon", and "Mitsubishi" make up only 12.64% of the market, half of the top 3 and only about an eighth of the total market.<p

                        Furthermore the top 3 EV manufacturers "Tesla", "Audi", and "Nissan" own almost 30% of the entire market at 29.11%.
                         This places the top 3 companies well ahead of the next 3 big companies "Volkswagon", "Skoda", and "Kia" who own only 18.45% of the market.
                         Finally,  the last 4 companies "Porsche", "Renault", "BMW", and "Ford" make up 17.46% of the market. What this shows is that the majority of EV's come from the top 10 companies. Not all top 10 are equal however as the top 3 companies own almost as much as the next 7 combined.<p

                    <div class="card-body "><h3 style="font-weight: bold;">Figure 3</h3> The bar chart above compares the largest gas car companies and their average miles per gallon (MPG) in cities. This shows that while there is some variation in data, most car manufacturers are equal in the city except for "CODA Automotive", "Smart", "Grunman Olson", and "Scion".
                        Most companies sit around the 16.5 MPG range meanining you should use that as your baseline when buying, anything above would be better than average while anything below would less than average. Everything below Mercedes-Benz would be considered below average in terms of MPG. However, if you could get a car from one of the top 4 companies that would be best as their cars are up to 4.67x better in the city compared to the average.<p

                    <div class="card-body "><h3 style="font-weight: bold;">Figure 4</h3> The bar chart above compares EV manufacturers to their average MPG equivalent. It can be seen that EV's are able to run for much longer compared to traditional gas cars as even the lowest ranked EV manufacturer, Byton, surpasses the highest gas manufacturer, CODA Automotive.
                        Within the EV sphere the avergae MPG equivalent is around 111.63 with the companies "DS", "Citroen", and "Lucid". As such you should use this as your baseline when comparing the MPG equivalents.

What this shows is that many gas vehicles sit around the 400 range in terms of gas emissions. As such you should focus on shooting below this to help limit gas emisstions. <p

                    <div class="card-body "><h3 style="font-weight: bold;">Figure 6</h3> The scatter plot above compares the weight (lbs) to CO2 emissions grams per mile (g/mi). Generally as weight increases so does the CO2 emissions.
                        While there exists a lot of variation in the CO2 emissions for similar weights, generally the 4k to 5k pound vehicles contain the highest CO2 emissions thus you should purchase a car below this weight to limit excess CO2.
                        As such when purchasing a car you should aim to get a smaller one to reduce CO2 emissions.<p

                        People should not just focus on the MPG within the city but also on the highways because if you ever decide to travel then you would like to have a better MPG than average. <p

                        This suggests that people should hold off on buying vehicles if they do not need a new one because as technology gets better cars become more effecient.<p
